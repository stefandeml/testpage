<p>Zokrates is a toolbox for zkSNARKs on Ethereum.</p>
<a class="header" href="#background-on-zksnarks" id="background-on-zksnarks"><h2>Background on zkSNARKs</h2></a>
<p>Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are a family of probabilistic protocols, first described by <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Proof%20Systems/The_Knowledge_Complexity_Of_Interactive_Proof_Systems.pdf">Goldwasser, Micali and Rackoff</a> in 1985.</p>
<p>On particular family of ZKPs is described as zero-knowledge <strong>S</strong>uccinct <strong>N</strong>on-interactive <strong>AR</strong>guments of <strong>K</strong>nowledge, a.k.a. zk-SNARKs. zk-SNARKs are the most widely used zero-knowledge protocols, with the anonymous cryptocurrency Zcash and the smart-contract platform Ethereum among the notable early adopters.</p>
<p>For further details we refer the reader to some introductory material provided by the community: <a href="https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/">[1]</a>,<a href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/zk-snarks-under-the-hood-b33151a013f6">[2]</a>, <a href="https://blog.decentriq.ch/zk-snarks-primer-part-one/">[3]</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#motivation" id="motivation"><h2>Motivation</h2></a>
<p>Ethereum runs computations on all nodes of the network, resulting in high costs, limits in complexity, and low privacy. zkSNARKs have been enabling to only verify computations on-chain for a fraction of the cost of running them, but are hard to grasp and work with.</p>
<p>Zokrates bridges this gap. It helps you create off-chain programs and link them to the Ethereum blockchain, expanding the possibilities for your dApp.</p>

<a class="header" href="#getting-started" id="getting-started"><h1>Getting Started</h1></a>
<a class="header" href="#installation" id="installation"><h2>Installation</h2></a>
<p>Using Docker is currently the recommended way to get started with Zokrates.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">docker run -ti zokrates/zokrates /bin/bash
</code></pre>
<p>Now you should be dropped into a shell and can find the <code>zokrates</code> executable in the following folder <code>ZoKrates/target/release</code>.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can build the container yourself with the following commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git clone https://github.com/JacobEberhardt/ZoKrates
cd ZoKrates
docker build -t zokrates .
docker run -ti zokrates /bin/bash
cd ZoKrates/target/release
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you can build Cargo from <a href="https://github.com/JacobEberhardt/ZoKrates/">source</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#first-steps-with-zokrates" id="first-steps-with-zokrates"><h2>First Steps with ZoKrates</h2></a>
<p>First, create the text-file <code>add.code</code> and implement your program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zokrates">def main(field a, field b, field c) -&gt; (field):
  return a + b + c
</code></pre>
<p>The keyword <code>field</code> declares the type of the parameters used as elements of the underlying finite field.</p>
<p>Then run the different phases of the protocol:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./zokrates compile -i 'add.code'
./zokrates setup
./zokrates compute-witness -a 1 2 3
./zokrates generate-proof
./zokrates export-verifier
</code></pre>
<p>The CLI commands are explained in more detail in this <a href="reference/cli.html">section</a> of the doc.</p>
<a class="header" href="#proofing-a-hash-pre-image" id="proofing-a-hash-pre-image"><h1>Proofing a Hash Pre-Image</h1></a>
<p>Let’s jump into ZoKrates by working through a hands-on project together! This chapter introduces you to the basic features of ZoKrates and to how to use zkSNARKs in a real-world example.</p>
<p>We’ll implement a problem that's very typical in blockchain use-cases: proving the knowledge of a pre-image for a given SHA256  hash-digest.</p>
<p>We will begin with demystifying this machinery by computing the SHA256 hash of the number <code>5</code>. Therefore we navigate through multiple implementations of this hash computation using different programming languages: Python (accessible and easy to debug), ZoKrates (to compile the zkSNARKs program) and Solidity (to close the loop with the Ethereum blockchain).</p>
<p>In the second part we show how ZoKrates and the Ethereum blockchain can be used to allow a proofer, let’s call her Alice, to demonstrate beyond any reasonable doubt to a verifier, let’s call him Victor, that she knows a hash pre-image for a chosen hash-digest by Victor, without revealing what the pre-image is.</p>
<a class="header" href="#pre-requisites" id="pre-requisites"><h2>Pre-requisites</h2></a>
<p>Make sure you have followed the instructions in the <a href="gettingstarted.html">Getting Started</a> chapter and are able to run the &quot;Hello World&quot; example described there.</p>
<p>Note that you also need a working Python environment to reproduce the full tutorial. The Python section, however, is optional and for educational purpose only.</p>
<a class="header" href="#python-implementation" id="python-implementation"><h2>Python Implementation</h2></a>
<p>We will start by implementing our example hash problem using Python.</p>
<p>Have a look at the following Python code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">import hashlib  

preimage = bytes.fromhex('00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 05')

bin(int(preimage.hex(), 16)) //binary represantation of pre-image 
//out
//'0b101'

hashlib.sha256(preimage).hexdigest() //compute hash
//out
//'c6481e22c5ff4164af680b8cfaa5e8ed3120eeff89c4f307c4a6faaae059ce10'
</code></pre>
<p>Let's go through this example line-by-line.
Clearly, the first line imports the <code>hashlib</code> module which implements most of the common secure hash and message digest algorithms.<br />
Following this we define our 512bit pre-image using hexadecimal notation and assign the resulting byte object to the variable <code>preimage</code>. Please note that the input needs to be exactly 512bit long, hence we have to pad the input with <code>00</code> hex values.
Based on that we arrive at the binary form of the pre-image:<code>'0b101'</code>, however missing the padding in this case.</p>
<p>Finally we compute the SHA256 digest for this pre-image which returns the following hex-string:
<code>'c6481e22c5ff4164af680b8cfaa5e8ed3120eeff89c4f307c4a6faaae059ce10'</code></p>
<p>Calling <code>bin</code> we easily obtain a binary representation of the hash-digest.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">bin(0xc6481e22c5ff4164af680b8cfaa5e8ed3120eeff89c4f307c4a6faaae059ce10)
//out
//'0b1100011001001000000111100010001011000101111111110100000101100100101011110110100000001011100011001111101010100101111010001110110100110001001000001110111011111111100010011100010011110011000001111100010010100110111110101010101011100000010110011100111000010000'
</code></pre>
<p>In the following section we will try to reproduce this result first using ZoKrates and then using Solidity.</p>
<a class="header" href="#zokrates-implementation" id="zokrates-implementation"><h2>ZoKrates Implementation</h2></a>
<p>The goal for this chapter is to run the same hash calculation in a zkSNARK using ZoKrates.</p>
<p>First, we create a new file named <code>hashexample.code</code> with the following content:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>main</code> function does not take any input arguments. Having a closer look, the defined program is just calling the <code>sha256</code> function using 512 field elements as an input. Unsurprisingly, we set the input values to our pre-image, i.e. <code>5</code>, using the same binary encoding we derived above. In addition, we declare 256 field elements and set them to the output of the hash-function. The last line defines the return statement for all these elements, i.e. the computed hash-digest.</p>
<p>Having our problem described in code we can continue using ZoKrates for the rest of our workflow.</p>
<p>First, we compile the program into an arithmetic circuit using the <code>compile</code> command.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">./zokrates compile -i hashexample.code
</code></pre>
<p>As a next step we can create a witness file using the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">./zokrates compute-witness
</code></pre>
<p>Note that that <code>-a</code> flag is not used in this case as we do not have to specify any public input argument for this program.</p>
<p>Still here? Great! At this point, we can compare the created witness with the result obtained above.</p>
<p>Let's run the following bash magic in the console:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">grep -r '~out_' witness | awk '{split($0,a,&quot;out_&quot;); print a[2]}' | sort -k1 -n | head -n 25 |  awk -F ' ' '{print $2}' | tr  -d '\n'  
</code></pre>
<p>which results in the following output:<br />
<code>1100011001001000000111100%</code></p>
<p>Recalling the 25 most significant bits of the hash digest obtained in the Python section</p>
<p><code>1100011001001000000111100</code></p>
<p>we can easily see that the two results are equivalent.</p>
<a class="header" href="#solidity-implementation" id="solidity-implementation"><h2>Solidity Implementation</h2></a>
<p>As a final step we implement our example hash problem using Solidity and run the code on the test-net.</p>
<p>First, we create a new project using <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/">Remix</a> which works as a web IDE for Solidity development. Then we create a new file named <code>hashexample.sol</code> with the following content:</p>
<pre><code class="language-solidity">pragma solidity ^0.4.24;
contract SHA256Test {
        event Success(
        bytes32 indexed _id
    );

    function calc_sha() public returns (bytes32)  {
        bytes32 a = 0x0;
        bytes32 b = 0x5;

        bytes32 digest = sha256(a,b);
        emit Success(digest);
        return digest;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Let's go over the main logic in that code: The function <code>calc_sha</code> takes two 32-byte long inputs, representing the total 512bits described above, and calls the EVM opcode for SHA256. The result of the computation is stored in <code>digest</code>. In addition the event <code>Success</code> is defined and being emitted with the computed hash-digest as input.</p>
<p>No we can compile the contract and deploy it on your preferred Ethereum test-net. The next step is to call the public function <code>calc_sha</code> from the Remix UI.</p>
<p>Following this the Remix console should show this event being logged:</p>
<p><code>bytes32: 0xc6481e22c5ff4164af680b8cfaa5e8ed3120eeff89c4f307c4a6faaae059ce10</code></p>
<p>Based on that result the hash-digest for our hash pre-image is the following hex-encoded 256bit string:</p>
<p><code>0xc6481e22c5ff4164af680b8cfaa5e8ed3120eeff89c4f307c4a6faaae059ce10</code></p>
<p>Having this output we can compare it to the hash digest obtained in the Python and ZoKrates implementation. Clearly, we can state all three results are equivalent.</p>
<a class="header" href="#prove-knowledge-of-pre-image" id="prove-knowledge-of-pre-image"><h2>Prove knowledge of pre-image</h2></a>
<p>At this point you might be wondering how all of this is useful. For now we have seen that besides computing our hash in Python we can now compute it using heavy finite field arithmetics on elliptic curves using ZoKrates as well as on the global state machine Ethereum using Solidity.</p>
<p>Let's recall our goal: Peggy wants to proof that she knows a pre-image for a chosen hash-digest by Victor, without revealing what the pre-image is. Without loss of generality let's now assume that Victor choses the hash-digest to be equivalent to our example above.</p>
<p>To make it work the two parties have to follow their roles in the protocol:</p>
<p>First, Victor has to specify what hash digest he is interested in. Therefore, we have to adjust the zkSNARK compiled by ZoKrates such that it also validates the computed hash-digest with the hash-digest of interest. This leads to the following update for <code>hashexample.code</code>:</p>

<p>Note that we now have defined the main function such that it takes 512 private input arguments. This input is then being used as the pre-image to compute the hash-digest similar to the example above.
In addition we assert the result bit by bit with the hard-coded correct solution defined by Victor.  Clearly, this program only returns true if all of the computed bits are equivalent.</p>
<p>Ok, having defined the program Victor is now ready to compile the code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">./zokrates compile -i hashexample.code
</code></pre>
<p>Based on that Victor can run the setup phase and export the Solidity verifier smart contract:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">./zokrates setup
./zokrates export-verifier

<p><code>setup</code> will create a <code>verifiation.key</code> file and a <code>proving.key</code> file. Victor must make the <code>proving.key</code> publicly available to Alice.</p>
<p><code>export-verifier</code> creates a <code>verifier.sol</code> Solidity contract file that contains our verification key and a nifty function <code>verifyTx</code>. Victor deploys this smart contract to the Ethereum network.</p>
<p>Alice uses the <code>proving.key</code> to compute a witness to the problem:</p>

<p>Note that Alice now provides the correct pre-image as an argument to the program. However, these inputs are declared as private variables in the program  and don't leak to Victor due to the zero knowledge aspect of the protocol.</p>
<p>Finally Alice can run the command to create the proof:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">./zokrates generate-proof
</code></pre>
<p>ZoKrates creates a file for the proof consisting of the eight variables that make up a zkSNARKs proof. The <code>verifyTx</code> function in the smart contract deployed by Victor accepts these eight values, along with an array of public inputs. The expected output of the program is also defined as public input, hence Alice has to define her public input array as follows: <code>[1]</code></p>
<p>Victor is continuously monitoring this smart contract. As soon as he observes a successful call to the <code>verifyTx</code> function by Alice's public address, he can be sure that Alice has a valid pre-image for the SHA256 hash-digest he has put into the smart contract.</p>
<a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary"><h2>Summary</h2></a>
<p>At this point, you’ve successfully ran you first zkSNARK on the Ethereum blockchain! Congratulations!<br />
This project was a hands-on way to introduce you to ZoKrates and the workflow to develop dApps using zkSNARKs.</p>
<p>Remember that in this example only two parties have been involved. This special case makes it easy to deal with zkSNARK's trust assumptions: Only Vitor was interested in verifying the claim by Alice, hence he can trust his execution of the setup phase.
However, in more general use-cases there might be multiple parties interested in verifying the correctness of Alice's statement. For example, in the zero-knowledge based cryptocurrency zCash every node needs to be able to validate the correctness of transactions. In order to generalize the setup phase to these multi-party use-cases a tricky process, commonly referred to as “trusted setup” or &quot;ceremony&quot; needs to be conducted. Currently, ZoKrates doesn't provide support for these types of setups.</p>
